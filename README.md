This is the GitHub repo for Team One's Software Engineering Project for the 2023/24 teaching year. You will find all relevant code (including .exe files) here. Some paperwork is here too but I strongly urge markers to look at our Notion Workspace for all documentation (including our final report) because any documents here are duplicates of what is on Notion.
